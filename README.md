# Railway-Track-Crack-Detection
In proposed system crack in the tracks are detected by means of sensor and Arduino microcontroller, measuring distance for two railroad. In this project we use ultrasonic sensor to detect the crack. It uses to measure the distance between the two tracks. If any crack is occurred in the track means longitude and latitude coordinates of the place are to be sent to the nearest station or control room and ultrasonic sensor measured the distance between the two track if there is any small variance found the message which contains coordinates of that particular place will be sent to the nearest station or control room with the help of GPS and GSM module. This project is to be made in order to change the system of crack detection in railways which can be resulted out as not only cost-effective but also with good accuracy and time saving facility. The main aim is to automatically detect cracks in railway track using Ultrasonic Sensors which will be attached to the Loco and sends the location of the cracks to the designated receiver using GSM & GPS.
